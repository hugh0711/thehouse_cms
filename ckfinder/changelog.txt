### Version 1.2.3

- Fixed security issues in server connector (directory traversal attack vulnerability)
- When uploading files, a JavaScript error was being thrown if an error
  occurred during the upload process.

### Version 1.2

- CKFinder is now fully localizable. The German, Italian, Polish and Spanish localization is included.
- Icons are now displayed for files in List view.
- Custom dialog boxes are now being used to avoid issues with popup blockers.
- New configuration option added to hide specific folders and files.
- New configuration option added to check size of uploaded image after scaling.
- Creating and removing a folder with the same name was causing an error.
- The UI will now reflect changes in the ACL when the Refresh button is used.
- File extensions are now checked in the client side before uploading.
- The [+] icons is now shown in the root folders only if subfolders are available.
- The # character is now properly encoded in the URL returned by CKFinder if
  that character is present in the file name.

### Version 1.1

- Attention!!! The ckfinder.config file has been replaced with config.ascx,
  which now uses pure C# syntax instead of XML. It makes it possible to add any
  kind of code in the settings, giving much more flexibility. Previous
  configuration files must be "translated" to the new format.

- Attention!!! Some additional security features have been introduced, changing
  the behavior present on previous versions:
    - The CheckAuthentication() function has been introduced in the
      configuration file. It must return "true" to CKFinder to work. Pay
      attention to the comments you will find there.
    - Allowed/denied extensions list is now used to filter displayed files. In
      previous versions it was used only to restrict file uploads)
    - In the default config file, the allowed extensions list is now defined
      instead of denied extensions list (white list approach).
    - Automatic detection of invalid image files on upload.
    - Disabling the upload if HTML is found inside specific files to prevent
      against UXSS.

- Full server side source code is now available.
- CKFinder is now compatible with Safari 3 (WebKit based browsers) and
  Opera 9.5.

  domains" security setting. 
- CKFinder is now fully compatible with FCKeditor 2.5, including QuickUpload

- Improved speed of thumbnails loading by CKFinder. HTTP code 304 is being sent
